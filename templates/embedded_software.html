Embedded software is computer software, written to control machines or devices that are not typically thought<br />
of as computers, commonly known as embedded systems. It is typically specialized for the particular hardware that<br />
it runs on and has time and memory constraints. This term is sometimes used interchangeably with firmware. A precise<br />
and stable characteristic feature is that no or not all functions of embedded software are initiated/controlled<br />
via a human interface, but through machine-interfaces instead. Manufacturers build embedded software into the electronics of cars,<br />
telephones, modems, robots, appliances, toys, security systems, pacemakers, televisions and set-top boxes, and digital watches,<br />
for example. This software can be very simple, such as lighting controls running on an 8-bit microcontroller with a few kilobytes<br />
of memory with the suitable level of processing complexity determined with a Probably Approximately Correct Computation framework <br />
(a methodology based on randomized algorithms). However, embedded software can become very sophisticated in applications<br />
 such as routers, optical network elementsï¼Œairplanes, missiles, and process control systems.<br />
